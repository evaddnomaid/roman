Math package based on roman numerals

## Why?

Most Americans disapprove of requiring instruction in Arabic numerals
in our schools:

> More than half of Americans believe “Arabic numerals” – the standard symbols used across much of the world to denote numbers – should not be taught in school, according to a survey.

> Fifty-six per cent of people say the numerals should not be part of the curriculum for US pupils, according to research designed to explore the bias and prejudice of poll respondents.

> A survey by Civic Science, an American market research company, asked 3,624 respondents: “Should schools in America teach Arabic numerals as part of their curriculum?” The poll did not explain what the term “Arabic numerals” meant.

> Some 2,020 people answered “no”. Twenty-nine per cent of respondents said the numerals should be taught in US schools, and 15 per cent had no opinion.

> Seventy-two per cent of Republican-supporting respondents said Arabic numerals should not be on the curriculum, compared with 40 per cent of Democrats. This was despite there being no significant difference in education between the two groups.

## What's this mean?

In light of this fact, it seems likely that Arabic numerals will soon be phased out in favor of tried-and-true Roman numerals.

## How can we respond?

The best thing to do right now is to get prepared.  In a world without Arabic numerals, Roman numerals will be more important than ever.  Similar to the YMM (aka "Y2K") problem, we need to gear up for the change-over.

## What's this repo about then?

Here the Roman team is developing software to fully replace Arabic numerals with Roman-only packages for arithmetic. 

## What are the goals of the project?

At first, we may rely on Arabic numerals in some places, but our goal is to have a completely Arabic-numeral-free package.  (We also intend to replace the binary digits 0 and 1 with O and I.)
